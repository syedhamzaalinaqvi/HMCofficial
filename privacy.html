                Welcome to <a href="https://hamzamoviesclub.online/">HamzaMoviesClub</a>  (the “Site”). We understand that privacy online is important to users of our Site, 
                especially when conducting business. This statement governs our privacy policies with respect to those users of the Site (“Visitors”) who 
                visit without transacting business and Visitors who register to transact business on the Site and make use of the various services offered 
                by AllMoviesHub (collectively, “Services”) (“Authorized Customers”).
                
                <h3 class="privacypgh3">“Personally Identifiable Information”</h3>
                
                refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains, including,
                but not limited to, name, address, phone number, fax number, email address, financial profiles, social security number, and credit card information.
                Personally Identifiable Information does not include information that is collected anonymously (that is, without identification of the individual user)
                or demographic information not connected to an identified individual.
                
                What Personally Identifiable Information is collected?
                
                We may collect basic user profile information from all of our Visitors. We collect the following additional information from our Authorized Customers: 
                the names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of Authorized Customers, the nature and size of the business, and the nature and size of the
                advertising inventory that the Authorized Customer intends to purchase or sell.
                
                What organizations are collecting the information?
                
                In addition to our direct collection of information, our third party service vendors (such as credit card companies, clearinghouses and banks) 
                who may provide such services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect this information from our Visitors and Authorized Customers.
                We do not control how these third parties use such information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use personal information provided to them 
                from Visitors and Authorized Customers. Some of these third parties may be intermediaries that act solely as links in the distribution chain, and
                do not store, retain, or use the information given to them.
                
                How does the Site use Personally Identifiable Information?
                
                We use Personally Identifiable Information to customize the Site, to make appropriate service offerings, and to fulfill buying and selling requests
                on the Site. We may email Visitors and Authorized Customers about research or purchase and selling opportunities on the Site or information related 
                to the subject matter of the Site. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to contact Visitors and Authorized Customers in response to 
                specific inquiries, or to provide requested information.
                
                With whom may the information may be shared?
                
                Personally Identifiable Information about Authorized Customers may be shared with other Authorized Customers who wish to evaluate potential 
                transactions with other Authorized Customers. We may share aggregated information about our Visitors, including the demographics of our Visitors 
                and Authorized Customers, with our affiliated agencies and third party vendors. We also offer the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving information 
                or being contacted by us or by any agency acting on our behalf.
                
                <h3 class="privacypgh3">Cookies</h3>
                
                A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time 
                the visitor returns.
                
                Are Cookies Used on the Site?
                
                Cookies are used for a variety of reasons. We use Cookies to obtain information about the preferences of our Visitors and the services they select. 
                We also use Cookies for security purposes to protect our Authorized Customers. For example, if an Authorized Customer is logged on and the site is 
                unused for more than 10 minutes, we will automatically log the Authorized Customer off. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
                computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using http://hamzamoviesmoviesclub.000webhostapp.com, with the drawback that certain features of website may not
                function properly without the aid of cookies.
                
                Cookies used by our service providers
                
                Our service providers use cookies and those cookies may be stored on your computer when you visit our website. You can find more details about which 
                cookies are used in our cookies info page.
                
                
                All of our employees are familiar with our security policy and practices. The Personally Identifiable Information of our Visitors and Authorized Customers
                is only accessible to a limited number of qualified employees who are given a password in order to gain access to the information. We audit our security systems 
                and processes on a regular basis. Sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers, is protected by encryption protocols, 
                in place to protect information sent over the Internet. While we take commercially reasonable measures to maintain a secure site, electronic communications 
                and databases are subject to errors, tampering, and break-ins, and we cannot guarantee or warrant that such events will not take place and we will not be 
                liable to Visitors or Authorized Customers for any such occurrences.
                
                How can Visitors correct any inaccuracies in Personally Identifiable Information?
                
                Visitors and Authorized Customers may contact us to update Personally Identifiable Information about them or to correct any inaccuracies by emailing us 
                at admin@hamzamoviesclub
                
                Can a Visitor delete or deactivate Personally Identifiable Information collected by the Site?
                
                We provide Visitors and Authorized Customers with a mechanism to delete/deactivate Personally Identifiable Information from the Site’s database by contacting.
                However, because of backups and records of deletions, it may be impossible to delete a Visitor’s entry without retaining some residual information. An individual
                who requests to have Personally Identifiable Information deactivated will have this information functionally deleted, and we will not sell, transfer, or use Personally 
                Identifiable Information relating to that individual in any way moving forward.
                </p>
